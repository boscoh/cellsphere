# AGENT.md - Development Guide

Follow these instructions precisely for all sessions.

## Project Overview

"Cell" is a Vue 3 + Three.js interactive visualization: a glowing circle that
circumscribes a swarm of softly colliding, floating cells drifting in a
viscosity-controlled simulation.

- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Vite, `<script setup>` SFCs
- **Rendering**: Three.js (WebGLRenderer, OrbitControls from `three/addons`)
- **Physics**: custom velocity-based particle model (soft spring collisions, ring-wall bounces)

## Project Structure

- `src/App.vue` — thin Vue shell: lifecycle, reactive overlay UI, frame timing
- `src/sim.js` — `Simulation` class: cells, food, collision, mitosis, tails
- `src/constants.js` — all tuning constants
- `src/sceneSetup.js` — Three.js scene / renderer / camera / controls / sphere
- `src/materials.js` — shared geometries & materials
- `src/math.js` — pure helpers (random vectors, smoothstep, spatial-hash key)
- `src/main.js` — app bootstrap
- `src/style.css` — global reset / base styles
- `index.html` — entry HTML

## Commands

- **Dev**: `npm run dev` — Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
- **Build**: `npm run build` — Production build to `dist/`
- **Preview**: `npm run preview` — Preview production build

## Beads Workflow (MANDATORY)

This project uses [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking.
**Use `bd` commands instead of markdown TODOs.**

### Session Start
1. Run `bd ready` to list unblocked issues
2. Select highest-priority matching issue
3. Claim it: `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`

### During Work
- Create issues: `bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2`
- Update progress: `bd update <id> --notes="Progress..."`
- Add dependencies: `bd dep add <child> <blocks>`
- Types: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- Priorities: P0 (critical) → P4 (backlog)

### After Each Task (MANDATORY)
1. Close the issue: `bd close <id> --reason="..."`
2. Stage and commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "Close cell-<id>: description"`
3. Only then move to the next task

### Session End (Landing the Plane)
1. File issues for any remaining/follow-up work
2. Run quality gates: `npm run build`
3. Close finished issues, update in-progress items
4. Push to remote: `git pull --rebase && bd sync && git push`
5. Verify: `git status` shows "up to date with origin"

## Tuning Parameters

Defined in `src/constants.js`:

- `SPRING` — collision stiffness
- `RESTORE_RATE` — how fast cells return to base speed
- `WALL_RESTITUTION` — bounciness of the circle boundary
- `DAMPING` — velocity damping per second
- `CELL_COUNT` — number of cells
- `viscosity` (reactive) — scales the simulation clock; adjustable via overlay slider

## Code Style

- 2 spaces, no semicolons, single quotes
- Vue Composition API with `<script setup>`
- `camelCase` for variables/functions, `PascalCase` for components
- No comments unless the logic genuinely needs them
- Keep the physics state in each cell's `userData` (position/velocity in XZ, radius, mass, base speed, bob params)

## Subagents (opencode)

Use the `task` tool to run subagents for work the orchestrator can delegate. Each
subagent runs in a fresh context and returns one message; the orchestrator merges
results and shows you only the combined output.

### Types

- `explore` — fast codebase search: find files, grep, answer "how does X work".
  Use for broad sweeps (e.g. "find every place we write the tail matrix").
- `general` — multi-step research or execution for complex questions.

### Patterns

- Launch several independent subagents in ONE message (parallel) for independent
  sweeps, then wait for their results.
- Give each a precise task AND the exact value to return (no guesswork).
- Delegate research/search; do the implementation yourself in the shared context.
- Verify subagent findings — they can't see this session's state.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Dolt-powered version control with native sync
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update <id> --claim --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task atomically**: `bd update <id> --claim`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Quality
- Use `--acceptance` and `--design` fields when creating issues
- Use `--validate` to check description completeness

### Lifecycle
- `bd defer <id>` / `bd supersede <id>` for issue management
- `bd stale` / `bd orphans` / `bd lint` for hygiene
- `bd human <id>` to flag for human decisions
- `bd formula list` / `bd mol pour <name>` for structured workflows

### Sync

bd stores issue history in Dolt:

- Each write auto-commits to Dolt history
- Do not treat `.beads/issues.jsonl` as the sync protocol

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

For more details, see README.md and docs/QUICKSTART.md.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Beads Issue Tracker

Use Beads (`bd`) for durable task tracking in repositories that include it. Use the `beads` skill at `.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (project install) or `~/.agents/skills/beads/SKILL.md` (global install) for Beads workflow guidance, then use the `bd` CLI for issue operations.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready                # Find available work
bd show <id>            # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>           # Complete work
bd prime                # Refresh Beads context
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for all task tracking; do not create markdown TODO lists.
- Run `bd prime` when Beads context is missing or stale. Codex 0.129.0+ can load Beads context automatically through native hooks; use `/hooks` to inspect or toggle them.
- Keep persistent project memory in Beads via `bd remember`; do not create ad hoc memory files.

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses a Beads tracker—either the Go `bd` CLI or the Rust `br` CLI—for issue tracking, plus [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (`bv`) for graph-aware triage. Issues are stored in `.beads/`. `bv` auto-discovers supported JSONL exports, including `.beads/issues.jsonl` and legacy `.beads/beads.jsonl`.

**Choose the tracker CLI from this repository's instructions and configuration.** Use `bd` commands in a Go Beads workspace and `br` commands in a beads_rust workspace. Do not run both trackers against the same workspace or infer the tracker solely from the JSONL filename.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects. Instead of parsing .beads/issues.jsonl / .beads/beads.jsonl directly or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). The selected tracker CLI (`bd` or `br`) handles creating, claiming, modifying, and closing beads.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY --robot-* flags. Bare bv launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

# Token-optimized output (TOON) for lower LLM context usage:
bv --robot-triage --format toon
```

Before claiming, verify current state with the selected tracker: `br show <id> --json`/`br ready --json` or `bd show <id> --json`/`bd ready --json`. `recommendations` can include graph-important blocked or assigned work; only `quick_ref.top_picks` and non-empty `claim_command` fields represent claimable work.

#### Other bv Commands

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with unblocks lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |

#### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
```

### Tracker Commands for Issue Management

Use exactly one command family, matching the tracker configured for the repository.

#### Rust beads_rust (`br`)

```bash
br ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open --json          # All open issues
br show <id> --json                   # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2 --json
br update <id> --status=in_progress --json
br close <id> --reason="Completed" --json
br close <id1> <id2> --reason="Completed" --json
br sync --flush-only                  # Export DB to JSONL after Beads mutations
```

#### Go Beads (`bd`)

```bash
bd ready --json                       # Show issues ready to work
bd show <id> --json                   # Full issue details
bd create "..." -t task -p 2 --json
bd update <id> --claim --json         # Atomically claim work
bd close <id> --json
bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>
bd export --no-memories -o .beads/beads.jsonl  # Refresh the export read by bv
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Triage**: Run `bv --robot-triage` to find the highest-impact actionable work
2. **Verify**: Check the selected tracker's `show`/`ready` output before claiming
3. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress --json` or `bd update <id> --claim --json`
4. **Work**: Implement the task
5. **Complete**: Use the selected tracker's `close` command
6. **Refresh for bv**: Run `br sync --flush-only` or the `bd export` command above so the JSONL export is current

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready --json` and `bd ready --json` show unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: Use `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` or `bd dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Git Policy

Tracker commands do not grant permission to commit or push application code. Follow this repository's own git and tracker instructions before staging, committing, syncing, or pushing. If the repository says "commit only when asked," that rule overrides any generic workflow advice.
